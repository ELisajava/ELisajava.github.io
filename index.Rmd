I am a first-year Masterâ€™s student in Biostatistics at the Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University. Recently, I earned my Bachelor of Medicine degree, and my research interests focus on applying statistical methods to rare disease studies. In my free time, I enjoy exploring coffee shops, hiking, and discovering new clubs.
